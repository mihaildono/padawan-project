The **Padawan Project** is a collection of curated learning programs, utilizing specific
set of research backed tools, which allows anyone to consistently and effectively get educated.

## Why?
There are many different education systems in the world, most of them are very ineffective.
This effectiveness inconsistency is staggering, considering there is plenty of research
that supports optimal learning methods. Furthermore accessibility of information
nowadays allows for everyone to get **equal** opportunity to develop regardless of
their social and economic status, as well as their geolocation. The mission of this
project is to bring a system that defines a clear development path and explicit
use of necessary techniques to achieve that. Our vision is a world where knowledge
is a basic right and anyone has equal success in it.
