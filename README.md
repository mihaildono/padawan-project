# Padawan Project

![PadawanProject Logo](./logo.png)

The **Padawan Project** is a collection of curated learning programs, utilizing specific
set of research backed tools, which allows anyone to consistently and effectively get educated.

## Why?

There are many different education systems in the world, most of them are very ineffective.
This effectiveness inconsistency is staggering, considering there is plenty of research
that supports optimal learning methods. Furthermore accessibility of information
nowadays allows for everyone to get **equal** opportunity to develop regardless of
their social and economic status, as well as their geo-location. The mission of this
project is to bring a system that defines a clear development path and explicit
use of necessary techniques to achieve that. Our vision is a world where knowledge
is a basic right and anyone has equal success in it.

## Prerequisites

The program: _MUST_ be undertaken with a mentor or with support of AI
No prior knowledge is needed beforehand.

### Learning with AI

If you're using AI as your mentor (like ChatGPT, Claude, or GitHub Copilot), follow these steps for the best learning experience:

#### 1. Feed the Guide to Your AI

Before starting, provide the AI with context about the curriculum:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in your editor and use the integrated AI assistant
3. Give this prompt to it:

```
I'm working through the Padawan Project - a structured web development curriculum.
The guide follows this structure:
- Star Wars themed quotes and badges
- Helpful links section
- Prerequisites
- Teaching content with examples
- Trials (hands-on projects)
- Badges for completion

Please help me learn following this structure and progression.
```

#### 2. Effective Learning Prompts

Use these prompts to get the most out of AI mentorship:

**When starting a new topic:**
> "I'm about to start [topic name]. Can you quiz me on the prerequisites to make sure I'm ready?"

**When stuck on a concept:**
> "I don't understand [concept]. Can you explain it using a real-world analogy, then show me a simple code example?"

**When working on exercises:**
> "I'm working on [exercise name]. Don't give me the solution - instead, give me a hint about what approach to use."

**When you think you've solved it:**
> "Here's my solution to [exercise]. Can you review it and point out what I could improve, without showing me the code?"

**When debugging:**
> "I'm getting this error: [error message]. Instead of fixing it for me, can you ask me questions to help me debug it myself?"

**For deeper understanding:**
> "I completed [topic], but can you challenge me with a harder variation of the trial to test my understanding?"

#### 3. Best Practices for AI-Assisted Learning

- **Don't copy-paste solutions** - Ask the AI to guide you, not solve for you
- **Explain back** - After learning something, explain it to the AI in your own words
- **Request Socratic method** - Ask the AI to teach using questions rather than direct answers
- **Build incrementally** - Work through each section before moving to the next
- **Test yourself** - Ask the AI to quiz you before starting trials

Remember: The AI is your mentor, not your coder. The goal is to learn, not to finish quickly!

## Program is split into 3 phases
