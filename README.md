The **Padawan Project** is a collection of curated learning programs, utilizing specific
set of research backed tools, which allows anyone to consistently and effectively get educated.

## Why?
There are many different education systems in the world, most of them are very ineffective.
This effectiveness inconsistency is staggering, considering there is plenty of research
that supports optimal learning methods. Furthermore accessibility of information
nowadays allows for everyone to get **equal** opportunity to develop regardless of
their social and economic status, as well as their geolocation. The mission of this
project is to bring a system that defines a clear development path and explicit
use of necessary techniques to achieve that. Our vision is a world where knowledge
is a basic right and anyone has equal success in it.

## Prerequisites
The program: <br>
_MUST_ be undertaken with a mentor. <br>
Is **NOT** meant for people to learn by themselves!

No prior knowledge is needed beforehand.

Mentor should have 5+ years of experience in the domain and 2+ years of experience
working in soft-skill intensive environment.<br>
NOTE: exact experience is TBD

## Programs
[Front End Web Development][JS]

## Mentor Information
Ideally each group should consist of 2-4 people. As it is important for the students
to feel the sense of community, but not so much that the teacher is overwhelmed by
too many people.<br>
NOTE: This current constraint is due to use of scaffolding from "Zone Of Proximal Development"<br>
NOTE: See research regarding optimal class size

The whole program should be led by a *single* mentor, as to minimize the impact
of context switching for students, however it is recommended to have occasional
lectures with different lectors on more laid back topics, that are still
informative(eg. basic UX, history of web). This would allow the students to see
different view points of people, as it would widen their ability to work with different people.

No outside remarks should be made unless requested by the mentor. There is an
ongoing problem of different teachers/parents/students interfering with the work
of a teacher, thus disturbing the process. Throughout the program there should be
scheduled meetings where people outside of the group can submit their appeals and
have discussion with the mentors.

**MENTORS** should first visit the [teacher manual][teacher-manual]

## Principles
This programs try to stay as close as possible to the [Zone of proximal development][zone],
to maximize the efficiency of learning.<br>
Tasks should be constructed in [85% success rule][fail].<br>
Take into account the 5 stages of [Tuckman][Tuckman] Team Model to monitor team chemistry.<br>

## Techniques Guide
As mentioned above, the program relies on **practical** tools that dramatically enhance
the learning rate of the students. [Here][techniques] you can see step-by-step guide
how to implement those techniques in your teaching process.

## Class notes
Study room should be brightly lid<br>
Teaching should begin not too early, so that the individual is completely awake(10 am would be ideal).<br>
Study day should not exceed 6 hours.<br>
Sessions should be according to [Ultradian][Ultradian] rhythm.<br>
It is also advised to use the [Pomodoro][pomodoro] technique as well to utilize deep work
as much as possible.<br>
Each session should be a maximum of 1.5 hours divided in 3 pomodoros.<br>
There should be regular multi-person projects that promote cooperation.<br>
There should be regularly contests to train for real life scenarios and deadlines.<br>

## Group Chemistry
NOTE: Here we can put more suggestion how to improve team chemistry<br>
At regular intervals there should be organized teambuildings(search for proper research)
- hackaton
- cross-group competitions
- non-subject activities(karaoke, escape room, festival, cinema...)

## Badges and rewards
The program will make use of the [Random intermittent reward][reward] research.
Rewards should be mainly given at random intervals. Big and scheduled rewards
should be given only at big milestones(eg. completing the program)

| Name          | Description           | Reward    |
|---------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| Completionist | Solve 50 tasks        |           |
| Lootbox       | Random Daily reward   | Candy bar |
| Bullseye      | Center an element     |           |
| Loop Hero     | Loop through an array |           |
| Jedi          | Finish the program    | Party     |
## Research
Everything in this program should be backed with research. All of the related papers
will be stored [here][research]

## Roadmap
- Customized learning materials that contributing to the final
objective
- Mentor Network
- Sponsoring(Donations, NFT, state subsidies)
- Blockchain reward system
- Additional subjects

## Special Thanks
Using teaching tools was inspired by [Andrew Huberman][huberman]

## Additional notes
**This project will always be free.**
