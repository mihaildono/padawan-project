The **Padawan Project** is a collection of curated learning programs, utilizing specific
set of research-backed tools, which allows anyone to consistently and effectively get educated.

## Why?
There are many different education systems, most of which unfortunately very ineffective.
This effectiveness inconsistency is staggering, considering there is plenty of research
that supports optimal learning methods. Furthermore, accessibility of information
nowadays is a prerequisite for everyone to get **equal** opportunity to develop regardless of
their social and economic status, as well as their geolocation. The mission of this
project is to bring forward a system that defines a clear development path and explicit
use of necessary techniques to achieve that. Our vision is a world where knowledge
is a basic human right and everyone has equal opportunity to be successful in it.

## Prerequisites
The program is **NOT** tailored for people to learn by themselves and _MUST_ be taken under the guidance of a mentor.<br>
However, no prior knowledge in the matter is required.

## Programs
[Front End Web Development][JS]

## Mentor Information
Mentors should have 5+ years of experience in the respective domain and 2+ years of experience
working in soft-skill intensive environment*.<br>
_* Exact experience is TBD._<br>
### Groups
Ideally each group should consist of 2-4 people as it is important for the students
to feel the sense of community, but not so much that the teacher is overwhelmed by
too many people.<br>
NOTE: This current constraint is due to use of scaffolding from "Zone Of Proximal Development". See research regarding optimal class size.<br>

## General direction
The whole program should be led by a *single* mentor, as to minimize the impact
of context switching for students, however it is recommended to have occasional
lectures with different lectors on more laid back topics, that are still
informative(eg. basic UX, history of web). This would allow the students to see
different view points of people, as it would widen their ability to work with different people.

No outside remarks should be made unless requested by the mentor. There is an
ongoing problem of different teachers/parents/students interfering with the work
of a teacher, thus disturbing the process. Throughout the program there should be
scheduled meetings where people outside of the group can submit their appeals and
have discussion with the mentors.

**MENTORS** should first visit the [teacher manual][teacher-manual]

## Principles
This programs try to stay as close as possible to the [Zone of proximal development][zone],
to maximize the efficiency of learning.<br>
Tasks should be constructed in [85% success rule][fail].<br>
Take into account the 5 stages of [Tuckman][Tuckman] Team Model to monitor team chemistry.<br>

## Techniques Guide
As mentioned above, the program relies on **practical** tools that dramatically enhance
the learning rate of the students. [Here][techniques] you can see step-by-step guide
how to implement those techniques in your teaching process.

## Class notes
Study room should be brightly lit.<br>
Teaching should begin not too early, so that the individual is completely awake(10 am would be ideal).<br>
Study day should not exceed 6 hours.<br>
Sessions should be according to [Ultradian][Ultradian] rhythm.<br>
It is also advised to use the [Pomodoro][pomodoro] technique as well to utilize deep work
as much as possible.<br>
Each session should be a maximum of 1.5 hours divided in 3 pomodoros.<br>
There should be regular multi-person projects that promote cooperation.<br>
There should be regularly contests to train for real life scenarios and deadlines.<br>

## Group Chemistry
NOTE: Here we can put more suggestion how to improve team chemistry<br>
At regular intervals there should be organized teambuildings(search for proper research)
- hackaton
- cross-group competitions
- non-subject activities(karaoke, escape room, festival, cinema...)

## Badges and rewards
The program will make use of the [Random intermittent reward][reward] research.
Rewards should be mainly given at random intervals. Big and scheduled rewards
should be given only at big milestones(eg. completing the program)

| Name          | Description           | Reward    |
|---------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| Completionist | Solve 50 tasks        |           |
| Lootbox       | Random Daily reward   | Candy bar |
| Bullseye      | Center an element     |           |
| Loop Hero     | Loop through an array |           |
| Jedi          | Finish the program    | Party     |
## Research
Everything in this program should be backed with research. All of the related papers
will be stored [here][research]

## Roadmap
- Customized learning materials that contributing to the final
objective
- Mentor Network
- Sponsoring(Donations, NFT, state subsidies)
- Blockchain reward system
- Additional subjects

## Special Thanks
Using teaching tools was inspired by [Andrew Huberman][huberman]

## Additional notes
**This project will always be free.**
