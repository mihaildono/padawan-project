# Introduction

From this point on, the student should start doing his own research and only use
the mentor for clarification and advice.

A webpage is constructed of 3 main elements:

1. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
2. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
3. JS (JavaScript)

HTML is responsible for the layout of the page.
CSS is responsible for styling of the layout.
JS is responsible for what happens when the user interacts with the page.

This level is split into 3 parts:

1. Starting with the basics of [CSS][css] and cloning the Google landing page.
2. Getting into the gist of the program with [React][react].
3. Building a back-end with [Node.js & Express][node].
